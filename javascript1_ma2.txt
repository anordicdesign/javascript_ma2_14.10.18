//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?
Used as expression, and one doesn't need f name. It defines a unnamed function. 

2. What is the constructor?
Is used for working with Prototype objects or objects oriented js. 
It does not have a value. 

3. What does the return statement do?
It fetches parts of the code we want to be displayed or worked with. 
It returns values of functions.

4. What will be written to the console from this function:

		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();

'inside my function' will be displayed. 


5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.

Local scopes are not accessible from outside the functions or the variables?
And global scopes are? I felt unsure of scope. It felt very "within this code, 
is within this code"
